Need to add another plant to the database?  You can do that here.
Simply fill in the data fields below and click the "Add" button. Plant
names should be general (like "Tomato"), and variety should be more
specific (like "Sun Gold").  Plant spacing is done in inches, so
multiply 12 for any plants that are spaced by feet.  Rows are measured
by the foot and can only be whole numbers (no decimals).
