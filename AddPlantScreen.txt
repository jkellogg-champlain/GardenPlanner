Need to add another plant to the database?  You can do that here.
Simply fill in the data fields below and click the "Add" button. Plant
names should be general (like "Tomato"), and variety should be more
specific (like "Sun Gold").  Measurements are in feet, so if spacing is
done in inches, select 1 foot for spacing and add the number of plants
that fit in a square foot.  So if plant spacing is two inches, make Plant
Spacing 1 foot and number of Plants per Square Foot 6.
