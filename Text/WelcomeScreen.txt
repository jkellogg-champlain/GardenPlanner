Welcome to the Garden Space Planner.  To get started, click one of
the above buttons.  For quick reference, here's what you can
expect from each selection:

SELECT MAP: If you have existing maps, click this button to get a list
of them and access the one you want.

CREATE MAP:  If you have no maps or want to create a new one, click
this button to do so.  Once complete, you'll be able to  select and
add plant tiles to your map from the plant display column to the left.

ADD PLANT: The Garden Space Planner comes with a database of
many plants, but does not contain all plants.  Click this button to
add a plant to your garden database.  Your new plant will then be
displayed as a tile in the plant display column to the left, where you
can then select and drop it into a custom garden map.

EDIT PLANT: Change colors, text ad other information for an existing
plant in the database.
